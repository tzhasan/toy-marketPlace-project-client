          What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where
          should we store them on the client-side?
        </h1>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">Access Token:</span> An access token is
            a credential that is used to authenticate and authorize a user's
            access to protected resources on a server. It is typically a string
            of characters that represents the user's identity and permissions.
            Access tokens are short-lived and have an expiration time.
            <br />
            When a user logs in or authenticates, the server generates an access
            token and includes it in the response. The client then includes the
            access token in subsequent requests to access protected resources.
            The server validates the access token to ensure that the user has
            the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">Refresh Token:</span> A refresh token is
            a credential that is used to obtain a new access token when the
            current access token expires. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens
            are long-lived and have a longer expiration time. They are used to
            request a new access token without requiring the user to
            reauthenticate.
            <br />
            When the access token expires, the client sends a request to the
            server with the refresh token. If the refresh token is valid, the
            server responds with a new access token. This process helps maintain
            user sessions without repeatedly prompting for login credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Storage on the Client-side:</span> Both
            the access token and refresh token should be securely stored on the
            client-side to prevent unauthorized access. Here are some common
            approaches to storing them: Browser Cookies: Store the tokens as
            secure HTTP-only cookies. This helps protect them from cross-site
            scripting (XSS) attacks. Cookies are automatically sent with every
            request to the server. Local Storage: Store the tokens in the
            browser's local storage. Local storage provides persistence across
            sessions and can be accessed by JavaScript. However, it is
            vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Session Storage:
            Similar to local storage, session storage provides persistence
            within a single session. It can also be accessed by JavaScript but
            is cleared when the session ends.

          Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?

        <div className="space-y-2">
          <p>
            SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two
            different types of database management systems. Here's a comparison
            between SQL and NoSQL databases:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">SQL Databases:</span>Structure: SQL
            databases have a predefined schema that enforces a fixed structure
            for data storage. Data is organized into tables with rows and
            columns, and relationships between tables are established through
            keys (primary and foreign keys). <br />{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Data Integrity:</span> SQL databases
            enforce data integrity through constraints like primary key, unique
            key, foreign key, and referential integrity. These constraints
            ensure data consistency and maintain data integrity. <br />{" "}
            <span className="font-bold"> Query Language:</span> SQL databases
            use the SQL query language for data manipulation and retrieval. SQL
            offers a standardized way to interact with the database, allowing
            powerful querying capabilities and complex operations. <br />{" "}
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">NoSQL Databases:</span> <br />{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Schema Flexibility:</span> NoSQL
            databases offer schema flexibility, allowing the storage of
            unstructured, semi-structured, or dynamically changing data. There
            is no fixed schema, and each document or record can have different
            structures. <br /> <span className="font-bold">Scalability:</span>{" "}
            NoSQL databases excel at horizontal scalability, distributing data
            across multiple servers to handle large amounts of traffic and data
            volume. They can scale horizontally by adding more servers to the
            database cluster. <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Performance:</span> NoSQL databases
            often prioritize performance and high throughput. They are designed
            for handling massive read/write operations and can provide faster
            response times compared to SQL databases for certain use cases.

            In MongoDB, the aggregate operation is used for processing and
            analyzing data within a collection. It allows you to perform
            advanced data aggregation tasks, such as grouping, filtering,
            sorting, joining, and computing aggregations on your data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="font-bold">Pipeline Stages:</span> A pipeline
            consists of one or more stages, where each stage represents an
            operation to be applied to the data. Common stages include: <br />{" "}
            $match: Filters the documents based on specific conditions. <br />{" "}
            $group: Groups documents together based on a specified key or
            expression and performs aggregations within each group. <br />{" "}
            $sort: Sorts the documents based on specified fields.

            <span className="font-bold">Aggregation Functions:</span> MongoDB
            provides a set of built-in aggregation functions that you can use
            within the pipeline stages. These functions include $sum, $avg,
            $min, $max, $count, and many others. They allow you to calculate
            aggregations based on the values in the documents. <br />{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Result Output:</span> The aggregate
            operation returns the result of the pipeline as a cursor, which can
            be iterated to access the aggregated data. You can also use
            additional stages like $project or $group to shape the output and
            extract the desired information.
